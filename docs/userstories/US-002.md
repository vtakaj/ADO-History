# Calculate work periods

## Story
As a system
I want to calculate the period from Doing start to Done completion and exclude Blocked periods
So that I can accurately capture actual work time

## Implementation status
Not supported in the current implementation (planned).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify the timestamp when a ticket status changes to "Doing"
- [ ] Identify the timestamp when a ticket status changes to "Done"
- [ ] Calculate the period from Doing start to Done completion
- [ ] Identify the periods when status was "Blocked"
- [ ] Exclude Blocked periods from the work period
- [ ] Calculate work periods considering business days only
- [ ] Identify work periods with 90%+ accuracy

## Notes
Need to handle tickets that move between Doing and Blocked multiple times. Also reference a business calendar to compute actual work days excluding weekends and holidays.
