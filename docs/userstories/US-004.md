# Automatically generate monthly work summaries

## Story
As a system
I want to automatically generate monthly summary reports at the end of each month
So that I can automate the preparation of monthly reports

## Implementation status
Not supported in the current implementation (can be operated by combining `fetch` and `generate-work-table` via cron, etc.).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Automatically run summary generation at the end of each month
- [ ] Aggregate monthly work records for all members
- [ ] Include each member's total work time and ticket list
- [ ] Include participation records for shared events
- [ ] Notify administrators when summary generation completes
- [ ] Notify administrators when summary generation fails
- [ ] Complete summary generation within 10 minutes

## Notes
The monthly summary runs at night on the last business day of the month. The generated summary is stored in a database and can be reviewed from the next business morning. Past monthly summaries should be regeneratable.
