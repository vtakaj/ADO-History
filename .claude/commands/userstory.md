# Extract User Stories from Requirements Specification

## Command Usage
`/userstory`
- Example: `/userstory`

## Purpose
Extract and create user stories from the requirements specification document

## Important Notes
- Read `./docs/requirements.md` thoroughly
- Use `ultrathink` to thoroughly consider all processes and requirements
- Do not use emojis in file descriptions
- User story ID format: `US-000` (e.g., US-001, US-002, etc.)
- Use `./docs/template-userstory.md` as the template for individual user stories
- Ensure all user stories align with the project objectives and constraints

## Process Steps
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Read and analyze `./docs/requirements.md`
2. **User Story Identification**: Identify all potential user stories from functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Story Prioritization**: Prioritize user stories based on business value and technical dependencies
4. **Story Creation**: Create detailed user stories using the template

## TODOs Included in Tasks
1. Read `./docs/requirements.md` completely
2. Extract user stories and create a comprehensive list
   - Filename: `./docs/userstories/userstories.md`
   - Include story ID, title, priority, and brief description
3. Create detailed user story files for each identified story
   - Filename: `./docs/userstories/{user story ID}.md`
   - Use the template structure with proper acceptance criteria

## Output Files Structure
- **Directory**: `./docs/userstories/`
- **List file**: `userstories.md` (overview of all user stories)
- **Individual files**: `{user story ID}.md` (detailed user stories)

## Quality Criteria
- Each user story should be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable (INVEST)
- Acceptance criteria should be clear and measurable
- Stories should cover all major functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements should be addressed through appropriate user stories
- Stories should be written from the user's perspective
